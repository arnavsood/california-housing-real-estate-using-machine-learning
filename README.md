machine learning approach to predict real estate prices
California House’s Price Prediction (ML) :
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.
 The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanatory: 
This model can predict housing prices in California's different districts. We explored the data using advanced visualization techniques . 
We applied Ensemble learning techniques for the predictions and had an accuracy of 80 % in our model .
Sample of our Data Set :
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:
Longitude
•	Latitude
•	housing_median_age
•	total_rooms
•	total_bedrooms
•	population
•	households
•	median_income
•	median_house_value
•	ocean_proximity

                       
1.It is a 'Regression' problem because the label 'median_house_value' is continuous .           
2.We will apply all types of regression and predict the median_house_value .               
3.We will compare which type of regression is best for this prediction .	
4 . CONCLUSION

We can see that by the use of Random forest regression we are getting an accuracy of 79 % .
Hence  ' RANDOM FOREST ' could be the best model because of low mean squred error .
